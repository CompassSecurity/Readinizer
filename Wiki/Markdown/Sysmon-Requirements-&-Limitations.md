# Requirements
Sysmon runs on clients with the operating system "Windows 7" and higher, and on servers with "Windows Server 2008 R2" and higher. Moreover, to run the Scheduled Task "Windows 7" is the minimum required version.

The user needs permission to create a network folder and edit files in it.

The user needs access to the Active Directory and must be able to create and set a Group Policy Object on a domain.

# Limitations 
This guide was only tested on "Windows 10" and "Windows Server 2016" and is therefore limited to these operating systems. Theoretically this guide should work for all operating systems from Windows 7 and higher, or Windows Server 2008 R2 and higher. This however, was not tested for this guide.
